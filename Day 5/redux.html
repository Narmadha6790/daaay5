Need for redux
What is reduxRedux components
Settign up components
data flow

Need for Redux??

simple -> plain js
As you start managing dom  v start doing alot of ajax calls and,handle data intereactivity then -> jquery

^ above approach wen becomes very tedious think of REDUX
State management

As data flow gets more complex -> same data @ mutiple places , large state changes hard to manage
all state change @ one single place for consistency
 data flows gets more complex and complicated 
 
 React is jus a view hence to handle data flow we use react.

So to control the data flow we have redux to basically handle data flow architecture



Redux is a predictabl state container for back bone,ember,angular
Redux is all about how we store and update our app state
More sane state management
React has -> virtual dom
			synthetic events
			pure functions
			
			Pure functions
			The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.
The function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests, input and output devices, or data mutation.


Pure fucniton
function priceAfterTax(productPrice) {
 return (productPrice * 0.20) + productPrice;
}

Impure

var tax = 20;
function calculateTax(productPrice) {
 return (productPrice * (tax/100)) + productPrice; 
}

these above components help us in manage the


Redux simplifies all of our data source to one single store ( cud be componnents or anythign)
Redux called as store. So now components do not have to rely on multiple places but jus on the store

work flow
chain of commands

App -> fire action(tells what to do )
reducer goes and updates our app  based on what we wanted


tO WRAP IT UP

THE store is where our app state lives

an action decriebs what changes to be made

the reducer determines what the final state will be for an action


Principles of redux

 Your entire app is stored in one location
 Your state must be readonly and can be modified only through actions
 you jus specify what the final state shud be
 
 action is the only mechanism to contact store
 
 action can havea a variety of shape
 but it definately needs a typeproperty
 
 add color ,remove color --> action creators
 
 
 Reducer
 1. provides access to our stores original state
 2. allow s you to inspect the action that was currently fired.
 3.allws you to set our apps new store
 
 Reducer -> two args
 current state, action that was part of invoking it
 
 
 Shuld not do these 3
 mutate it args
 perform side effects like api call & routing
 
 call non pure function
 data.now math.random
 
 The way we can see dispatch to store
 
 
 
 _________________________________________
 
 
 Data flow through componenets
 (top -> bottom) parent to child components 
 
 
 One huge implication
 data is flowing in unicode-bidi
 child cannot pass to parent
 or to siblings
 non parent cannot communicate with each other
 Infact react does not encourage u to do so.
 
 
 Redux offers a solution to storign all your app state in onel place called the sotee
 
 components then dispatch & subscribe
 
 
 Principles
 Single store
 single immutable store
 direct comm between components not allowed
 dispathc & subscription
 
 State is read only
 only way to muttate state is through actions
 
 Change using pure functions
 done by reducers
 
 prevate,action type
